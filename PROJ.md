Individual Project:

What key problems are solved?
Rootfinding? Interpolation? Regression?
Is it general-purpose software or domain-specific? What makes it unique?
Who are the stakeholders?
Who develops the software, who uses it, who pays for it?
What are they looking for?
How do they communicate and collaborate?
Who uses the software?
Who is impacted (positively or negatively) by use of the software?
Metrics and features
How do concepts like accuracy, conditioning, stability, and cost appear?
If the software is fast, how is "fast" defined?
If the software is accurate, what does accuracy mean? Could you make a plot, say accuracy vs cost? How would you label the axes to make it relevant to a stakeholder?
Would different stakeholders want different axes (because they care about different things)?
Are there modeling decisions made in the interest of good conditioning? Are there algorithmic choices made for stability?
